Task:
This model predicts whether or not a student requires an additional well-being conversation with their teachers based on 20 factors.

Values:
This dataset contains the data of 1000 students who were surveyed on the 5 scientifically major factors that constitute to stress (i.e. psychological, physiological, social, environmental, and academic elements). Each input vector represents the survey response of one individual. The dataset consists of 20 binary input features, where a value of 0 signifies that the student does not exhibit each feature to a concerning degree. For example, for a feature such as 'anxiety level', a 0 value indicates that the student's anxietyis not at a concerning level, while a 1 denotes that it is. The training data set contains 880 data vectors, and the testing data set contains 220 data vectors.

Column meaning:
Each column represents a feature and the degree to which the student exhibits that feature.

Prediction:
We are predicting whether or not a student requires an additional well-being conversation with their teachers based on their input for 20 different features.
